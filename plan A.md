Based on the repositories and methods for ECG wave delineation outlined in the document, I recommend starting with torch_ecg as the most advanced option. This is a comprehensive PyTorch-based library that incorporates state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for ECG analysis, including wave delineation via sequence tagging and segmentation models. Here's why it's the top choice to begin with, especially for your project's setup involving Docker containers, data processing, and result aggregation:
## Why torch_ecg?

### Advancements and Modernity:
It supports cutting-edge architectures like U-Net (for segmentation/delineation), CRNN, and various CNN backbones (e.g., ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet), which align with recent deep learning trends in ECG processing as highlighted in 2025 reviews of DL for ECG analysis. These models enable precise identification of P, QRS, and T wave boundaries through sequence tagging, outperforming traditional algorithmic methods in handling noisy or arrhythmic signals. The library includes dedicated WaveDelineationMetrics for evaluating onsets/offsets/peaks, making it suitable for advanced tasks. It's actively maintained, with ongoing updates (e.g., Python support enhancements in 2025 changelogs) and benchmarks on datasets like CPSC2021, QTDB, and LUDB.
### Strengths:

Flexibility and Scalability: As a full library (pip-installable), it offers configurable components for preprocessing (e.g., bandpass filtering, normalization), augmentation (e.g., mixup, random masking), and multiple models. This makes it ideal for your system—easy to fine-tune, integrate with custom data, and extend for voting/ensemble decisions across algorithms.
Performance: Achieves high accuracy in delineation tasks (e.g., low mean errors on standard benchmarks), with built-in support for multi-lead ECGs and arrhythmias. It's designed for research and production, often cited in papers for state-of-the-art results in ECG segmentation.
Ease of Integration: GPU-compatible, with examples for training/inference, making Dockerization straightforward (e.g., using PyTorch CUDA images).


## Weaknesses and Limits:

Computationally intensive for large datasets or real-time use without optimization (requires GPU for best performance).
Some benchmarks may need manual updates after library changes, so test thoroughly in your container.
Relies on PyTorch ecosystem; if your project avoids DL dependencies, algorithmic options like NeuroKit2 might be lighter.


## Input/Output Formats (from document):

Input: Tensors (e.g., shape: batch × leads × length, like 2 × 12 × 4000); supports NumPy arrays via preprocessors.
Output: Dictionaries like WaveDelineationOutput with boundary indices (onsets, offsets, peaks) and metrics.


## Fine-Tuning and Improvements:

Highly customizable: Modify configs for CNN backbones, add new models (e.g., U-Net++ planned), or retrain on your datasets (e.g., PhysioNet QTDB/LUDB).
Use transfer learning from pre-trained weights; integrate with your system's data pipeline for augmentation or ensemble with other algorithms.
Contribute via GitHub for enhancements; active community for issues.


## Docker Notes (expanded for your use):

Build a container exposing an API (e.g., FastAPI) to receive ECG data (JSON/NumPy serialized), process via torch_ecg, and return delineations.
Sample Dockerfile:
```
textFROM pytorch/pytorch:2.4.0-cuda12.4-cudnn9-runtime  # Use CUDA for GPU if available
RUN pip install torch-ecg numpy scipy
WORKDIR /app
COPY app.py /app  # Your API script, e.g., load model, delineate, return JSON
EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["uvicorn", "app:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```
